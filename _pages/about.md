Hi there, I am a software engineer at the Machine Learning Platform at 
Netflix. I primarily work on enhancing [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/), an 
open source data science and machine learning orchestration framework. This 
involves working on various aspects of the platform, such as enabling robust 
and reliable access to data from Netflix's internal data lake (Iceberg), 
supporting different compute backends (e.g., AWS Batch, 
[Titus](https://netflixtechblog.com/titus-the-netflix-container-management-platform-is-now-open-source-f868c9fb5436)),
and deployment of machine learning models using an internal OpenFAAS-based platform called 
[Metaflow Hosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1TyQLZdgQE&ab_channel=Outerbounds).

Prior to joining Netflix, I was a graduate student at Georgia Tech, where I 
received my Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Machine 
Learning. My interests are primarily in Machine Learning Infrastructure, 
Robotics, and Computer Vision - and were shaped by my experiences as a 
software engineer at Amazon Robotics, and as a researcher at [Robotics Lab](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) 
at IIIT-Hyderabad, and [Precog Research Group](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) at 
IIIT-Delhi.
